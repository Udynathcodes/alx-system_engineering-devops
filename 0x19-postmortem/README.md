Postmortem: The Great Authentication Apocalypse of 2024 Report

By UDUAK-BONG UWAH (Udynath)


Issue Summary


Duration of the outage:

  
Start time: June 1, 2024, 4:30 am
  
 End time: June 1, 2024, 7:00 am  


Impact:

Service Affected: User Authentication Service  

User Experience: Users experienced the digital equivalent of being locked out of their own

 homes—an inability to log in to our platform on both web and mobile applications.  

Percentage of Users Affected: Approximately 85% of active users, or as we like to call it, 

"almost everyone and their cat."  

Root Cause:

 A misconfigured database connection string during a routine deployment caused the 

authentication service to play hide-and-seek with the primary database. Spoiler: the database

 was not amused.


Timeline (all time in GMT + 1)

14:30 am - Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication 

failures. Cue the dramatic background music.

4:32 am - On-call engineer notified through pager duty. Coffee was hastily prepared.

4:35 am - Initial investigation started; logs indicated database connection errors.

 "Houston, we have a problem."

4:45 am - Assumption: Possible database server issue. Database team alerted. 

Database team: "It's not us, it's you."

5:00 am - Database team confirmed database servers were operational. Focus shifted 

to application configuration. Detective hats on!

5:15 am - Misleading path: Suspected network issues between the application server and 

database. Network team: "Still not us."

5:30 am - Network team involved; no anomalies found in network connectivity. "Move

 along, nothing to see here."

6:00 am - Cross-functional team review of the latest deployment changes initiated. "Let's 

find the culprit!"

6:15 am - Configuration file with database connection string reviewed; misconfiguration
 
identified. "Aha!"

6:30 am  - Correct configuration applied and deployed. 

6:45 am - Authentication service gradually restored; continuous monitoring to ensure stability. 

Breathing resumed.

7:00 am - Full service restoration confirmed; incident officially closed. "We made it!"


Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:  


The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured database connection string in the

 authentication service configuration file. During a routine deployment, the connection string 

included an incorrect database host address, resulting in the authentication service failing to

 connect to the primary database. Essentially, it was like sending a love letter to the wrong 

address.

Resolution:  


The issue was resolved by:


1. Identifying the incorrect database connection string in the service configuration file. (Thanks, 

Sherlock!)

2. Correcting the database host address in the configuration. (Ah, sweet relief.)

3. Redeploying the authentication service with the correct configuration. (And the angels sang.)

4. Monitoring the service to ensure successful connections and user logins. (Better safe than 

sorry.)


Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements/Fixes:


1. Implement a deployment checklist that includes verification of configuration files. (Checklists 

are the new black.)


2. Enhance monitoring to include configuration validation checks. (More alerts, less drama.)


3. Introduce automated testing to simulate deployment environments and catch 

misconfigurations. (Robots to the rescue!)


4. Conduct regular training sessions for engineers on deployment best practices. (School’s in 

session.)


Task List:


1. Patch Deployment Process: Update the deployment pipeline to include automated 

configuration validation scripts. (No more blind deployments!)

2. Add Monitoring: Implement monitoring for configuration changes and database connection 

failures. (Keep your eyes peeled.)

3. Automated Testing: Develop and integrate automated tests to validate configuration settings 

before deployment. (Trust, but verify.)

4. Engineer Training: Schedule and conduct training workshops for engineers focused on

 deployment and configuration management. (Knowledge is power.)

5. Documentation: Update internal documentation to reflect the new deployment and monitoring 

processes. (Write it down, folks.)


In the end, we survived the Great Authentication Apocalypse of 2024 and came out stronger. 

Here's to hoping our next adventure is less exciting!
